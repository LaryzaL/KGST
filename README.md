# Project Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Technologies - Group 5

For this project, we had to expand a provided ontology in the domain of Hybrid Intelligence (HI). See below for an overview of all the 18 scientific papers we read in order to populate the original ontology with new classes, instances and properties:
1) Hybrid Collective Intelligence for Decision Support in Complex Open-Ended Domains
2) Egocentric Hierarchical Visual Semantics
3) Organizations’ interpersonal activity knowledge representation
4) Beyond Skills: The Role of Values in Job Seeking in the Era of Industry 5.0 
5) Towards an AI assistant for power grid operators
6) The Equity Framework: Fairness Beyond Equalized Predictive Outcomes 
7) Investigating Labeler Bias in Face Annotation for Machine Learning
8) Design of a Human-in-the-Loop Centred AI-Based Clinical Decision Support System for Professional Care Planning
9) EASY-AI_sEmantic And compoSable glYphs for representing AI
10) Monitoring Fairness in HOLDA
11) Abstracting Minds: Computational Theory of Mind for Human-Agent Collaboration
12) Humans vs. Machines: Who is Perceived to Decide Fairer? An Experiment about Citizens’ Attitudes
13) Monitoring AI Systems: A Problem Analysis, Framework and Outlook
14) Open, Multiple, Adjunct. Decision Support at the Time of Relational AI
15) Computer, Generate! – Investigating User-Controlled Generation of Immersive Virtual Environments
16) Best-Response Bayesian Reinforcement Learning with Bayes-adaptive POMDPs for Centaurs
17) MiniCoDe Workshops. Minimise Algorithmic Bias in Collaborative Decision Making with Design Fiction
18) POMDP-Based Adaptive Interaction Through Physiological Computing
